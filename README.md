# mini-loan-app
It is an app that allows authenticated users to go through a loan application. It contains fields “amount required” and “loan term.” All the loans will have a “weekly” repayment frequency. After the loan is approved, the user is able to submit the weekly loan repayments. It will just set the weekly amount to be repaid.
